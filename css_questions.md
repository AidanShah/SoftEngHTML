*1. What does CSS stand for?*

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." The term "cascading" comes from the cascading priority scheme, which is used to determine the order in which stylistic changes are made.

*2. Describe the syntax for writing CSS.*

A line of CSS code consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector chooses which HTML element to style, and the declaration block chooses how to style it.

*3. What is a class? How is it different from an ID?*

A class is a selector that is used to define style rules for elements with specific attributes. It is different from an ID selector which selects a single unique element from a page.

*4. What is a CSS Selector?*

I think we answered this question well in our answer for number 3.

*5. Explain the difference between these units: `px`, `em`, `vw`, `%`, `rem`*

These units are all used to express length.

px is called the "magic unit" of CSS because it is unrelated to the current font and usually unrelated to physical units like centimeters.

em is the unit that is equal o the font size. For example, em is equal to 2 inches when the font is equal to 2 inches.

vw is equal to 1% of the window's width. Not all browsers support vw since it's relatively new.

% is used when defining size as relative to the size of another object.

rem, which means "root em," is equal to the font size of the document's root element.
