### Questions:
1. What does HTML stand for?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Hypertext means that web pages can be connected to each other, and Markup means that you can annotate text, images and other elements of a website.

2. What is the syntax for writing HTML?

You should use brackets, which are tags in HTML, to set off elements from each other. Some examples of tags are "p" for paragraph, which encases a paragraph on the webpage.

3. Explain what "head" and "body" are and what they should contain.
  
  "head" is a metadata tag which contains everything important about the webpage. You do not see the info contained in it when you look at the webpage. "body" contains everything that you see on the webpage, such as images, paragraph text, and other visuals.

4. What are semantic elements, and why are they preferable to regular HTML elements?

It structures the code, making it more readable and easier to maintain. It also helps us to understand the hierarchy properly. 


5. What is the DOM?

The DOM is a model of an HTML document that treats it as tree in which ech element is connected to a parent element. The only exception is the document itself, which is the head of the tree. DOM stands for Document Object Model.
